# HTML and CSS (revisited) 🏠

### What is this?

Actually this is a revision of what I left after not coding and programming for a while. This habit happened when I faced two situations:

- I am constantly learning and using ReactJS, including NextJS and React Native. I already aware that HTML and CSS also important thing, instead of JavaScript.
- One of the recruiter told me that I have lacked projects and yeah, I do admit that I don't have much projects.

So, I have made a big decision that I want to solid my existing skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Instead of that, I also spending my minor leisure time to do some exercise Data Structued and Algorithms as well. 💯

### What is this contain?

Well, it just a few exercise and a few small CSS projects. Nothing fancy.

### After you completed it, what's next?

After I finished this small course, I have decided to implement all what I will learn to my real project that I am planning to develop it in React Native.

### Why React Native? Why not NextJS?

React Native is my main focus and because I have exposed to a minor part of configuring and setup and also do some XML design in Android. So, mobile development is my long dreams that I buried to the ground

### Why you revisit CSS? You can use TailwindCSS, Bootstrap out there for your projects though.

Yes, I know I can use TailwindCSS, Bootstrap and so on, you name it, for my projects but somehow some small company still use native CSS.

### Do you use Figma or Photoshop if you planning to design your project?

Nahhh... I don't use Figma or any designed tools for this moment. Because I don't know how to use it. 😊. But I have paper and pen to scratch my design. 😆
